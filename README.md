# snRNAseq Analysis

This repository contains example Python scripts for single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data preprocessing, quality control, integration, and annotation, developed as part of a neuroscience research project. Scripts are organized by workflow stage, illustrating common steps when working with large-scale transcriptomic data.

## Structure

- **Ambient_RNA/**  
  Scripts for background correction and ambient RNA removal.
- **QC/**  
  Quality control and metric visualization at sample and batch levels.
- **Integration/**  
  Batch integration and correction of technical covariates.
- **Annotation/**  
  Code for projecting cell type labels and assigning cell identities using semi-supervised learning.


## Notes

- Code is provided as illustrative workflow examples; not a complete production pipeline.
- Adapt paths and parameters as needed for your own data.
